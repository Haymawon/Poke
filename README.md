# DoYouEvenGif

A personal web playground to mix GIFs, music, memes, Pokémon, and a bit of chaos. Hosted for whoever finds it.

# Live website:

# What is this?
This is a personal, front-end-only project. It's a fun aggregator that connects to several public APIs, letting you explore different corners of the internet from one simple page.

Think of it as a lightweight, static website for quick browsing when you're bored.

# Features
The site is split into several "explorers":

· GIF Explorer: Browse trending GIFs by category (Cats, Anime, Reactions, Memes).

· Wiki Explorer: Search and read Wikipedia articles in different languages.

· Peek a Pics: Discover and filter royalty-free images from Pixabay.

· Tunes Explorer: Browse music, podcasts, and audiobooks from the iTunes Store.

· Pokédex Explorer: Search for detailed information about any Pokémon.

· Pokémon Quiz: Test your Pokémon knowledge with a simple multiple-choice quiz.

· Who Dis?: A small section about the creator.

# Getting Started
This is a static site. No build tools, package managers, or servers are needed.

1.Clone the repository



```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Haymawon/Poke.git
     cd Poke
```



2. Run it
   Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
· You can double-click it. 

· Or drag it into a browser window.

· That's it. The site runs completely client-side.

How It Works

The site is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All logic runs in your browser.

It works by making client-side requests to these public APIs:

· Tenor API for GIFs.

· Wikipedia API for articles.

· Pixabay API for images.

· iTunes Search API for music and podcasts.

· PokéAPI for Pokémon data.

There is no backend server in this repository. The site's functionality depends on the availability and rate limits of these external APIs.

# About

Made by Frutti (aka Haymawon). A space for coding, curiosity, and a mix of things I like: books, cats, coffee, and turning random ideas into web pages.

This is a personal project for fun and experimentation.
